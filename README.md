# hello-world
The first ever repository I've created on GitHub
Hi, my name is Husan Turdiev
I'm mostly interested in economics and business
and somehow in analytics and finance. The analytics because I'm bright at math, and finance because I love all money related stuff
and because I love analytics and am bright at math, I've decided to master my skills in DS and ML
And have read a lot that on GitHub I'll find what I'm looking for: an experience and teachers.
